# C++ College Tasks
## This repository contains 5 exercises from my C++ coursework. Each exercise is in a separate .cpp file and is explained below.

###  Exercises

#### FirstExersize.cpp

Given two numbers (either input by the user or defined in the code), calculate the sum of all even numbers in the range between them, inclusive.

#### SecondExersize.cpp

Check whether a given number (user input or constant) is positive, negative, or zero, and display the result.

#### ThirdExersize.cpp

The program has a string defined as const char*. Output the length of this string to the console.


#### FifthExersize.cpp

Find all “lucky” tickets from 000000 to 999999. A lucky ticket is one where the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three digits.

###  Compile & Run

Example for FirstExersize.cpp:
```
g++ FirstExersize.cpp -o FirstExTest
./task1
```
P.S The .gitignore file hides unnecessary files from you, while README.md is this description you are reading :)
