The folder includes 9 files, each representing a separate practical task:

- `Exersize1.cpp` — First programming exercise  
- `Exersize2.cpp` — Second programming exercise  
- `Exersize3.cpp` — Third programming exercise  
- `Exersize4.cpp` — Fourth programming exercise  
- `Exersize5.cpp` — Fifth programming exercise  
- `Exersize6.cpp` — Sixth programming exercise  
- `Exersize7.cpp` — Seventh programming exercise  
- `Exersize8.cpp` — Eighth programming exercise  
- `Exersize9.cpp` — Ninth programming exercise
